<h2>WALMART CHILE</h2>
<h3><b> Business Analyst/ Walmart Supply Chain</b></h3>

        <p style="word-wrap: break-word;">
            I was part of the technology team responsible for the supply chain systems for stores in Chile. The first successful project I participated in was the migration of Legacy systems (as400) to the new replenishment (GRS) and logistics (GLS) systems in the company's distribution centers. Throughout this project, I had two main tasks. The first was to design and implement a technological solution to support the replenishment of cold products (meat and vegetables) to stores across the country (300+ stores). The second successful task was to implement AS2 communication with suppliers so that they could receive purchase orders in EDIFACT96 format. Later, as a Business Analyst, I spent most of my time searching for improvement opportunities in Chile and investigating if there were any solutions in other markets where Walmart has a presence. Thanks to this, I was able to implement two important solutions for stores in Chile related to proper replenishment, the forwarding of purchase orders, and software to prevent self-replenishment from stores.
